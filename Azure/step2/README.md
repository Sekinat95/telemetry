# Step 2 - Create a Client Side App

The setup I have so far is not complete. To get it to work, you have to run an application (in this case nodejs) on monitoring laptop to receive and display the data. 
I want to be able to just open a web page from anywhere and see the data.  

I pondered what architecture I would need. The web page should be dynamic, showing real time data, not a static one-shot. I occurred to me that 
using a web page that has a websocket client connection to a websocket server (running somewhere in the cloud) would work. The actual web page
could be served statically, and it would connect back to the websocket server to get real time updates. The websocket server would incorporate
the IoT Hub client side code from ReadDeviceToCloudMessages to receive the data.

So here is an updated architecture diagram:

![alt text](../img/iot-experiment-4.png "Beaglebone -> IoT HUB -> Client -> Websocket -> HTML") 

## Turn the ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js Into a Node Module

The ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js file contains everything needed to receive the telemetry data from the IoT Hub. Now we need
to incorporate it into a web socket server. First thing is to modify that file to be a nodejs module. I chose to 
export its functionality as a class. Most of the code is exactly the same with some class scaffolding. 

I hit one hiccup when I first implemented the class version on a computer that was running nodejs version 12. One version supports 
a newer method of defining class methods using arrow function syntax. You can do this:

```javascript
class XYZ {
  ...

  myMethod = () => {
    ...
  }
}
```

That syntax is nice because it autobinds myMethod to the XYZ 'this', just like normal arrow functions. Unfortunately for me, I committed
this code to my repo and then downloaded it to a different machine running nodejs version 10. It immediately barfed all over that
code with syntax errors. It took me a minute to figure that out. So I changed the methods back to the conventional format, but then I
had a bunch of incorrect 'this' problems that took me another minute to figure out. I was getting errors from the innards of
the Azure IoT functions that didn't make sense. So I debugged and saw the callbacks had the wrong this. I changed my methods to 
bind them properly in the class constructor. I felt like I needed this to be portable to not require the latest JavaScript syntax.

Anyway, here is what I ended up with for the class version (renamed to TelemetryReceiver.js).
